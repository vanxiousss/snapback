# Snapback ImageView
An Instagram-like pinch-to-zoom Android ImageView with snap-back-to-original-position mechanism.

## Installation
Add the dependency below into your **module**'s `build.gradle` file:
### Gradle


```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation "io.github.vanxioussss:snapback-image-view:<latest_version>"
}
```

### Gradle Kotlin
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.vanxioussss:snapback-image-view:<latest_version>")
}
```

## Features

- Zoomable image views with pinch-to-zoom gestures.
- Snapback animation to return the image to its original position.
- Customizable attributes during zooming.
- Easy integration into existing projects. You just need to replace your current `ImageView` with `SnapbackImageView`.

## Usage

Add `SnapbackImageView` to your layout, or just replace your `ImageView` with `SnapbackImageView`:

```xml
<com.vanxiousss.snapback.SnapbackImageView
    android:id="@+id/snapbackImageView"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:src="@drawable/sample_image"
    app:shadowColor="#80000000"
    app:shadowMaxAlpha="192"
    app:shadowFadeEnabled="true"
    app:minScaleFactor="1.0"
    app:maxScaleFactor="5.0"
    app:endAnimationEnabled="true"
    app:endAnimationDuration="300" />
```

### Customization
You can customize the following attributes in XML:
- `shadowColor`: The color of the shadow during zooming.
- `shadowMaxAlpha`: The maximum alpha value for the shadow.
- `shadowFadeEnabled`: Enable or disable shadow fading.
- `minScaleFactor`: The minimum scale factor for zooming.
- `maxScaleFactor`: The maximum scale factor for zooming.
- `endAnimationEnabled`: Enable or disable the snapback animation.
- `endAnimationDuration`: Duration of the snapback animation in milliseconds.
